#  Predicting-Ideal-location-for-a-new-reastaurant-using-Yelp-dataset

This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the most recent dataset you'll find information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.

## Getting Started


- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning/Predictive Analytics to classify 1-5 star yelp reviews
- Applied Python NLTK Text classification to preprocess the Yelp reviews and perform sentiment analysis to analyze customer sentiments
- Utilized SVD for dimension reduction, K-Means, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines for data classification
- Used Latent Dirichlet allocation to automatically detect latent subtopics within the text of reviews
- Offered suggestions to find a favorable location to open a restaurant along with most favored food items in the areas of Phoenix, AZ

- Predicting Yelp Reviews using Bigram Multinomial Naive Bayes with Oversampling:
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning/Predictive Analytics to classify 1-5 star Yelp reviews!
